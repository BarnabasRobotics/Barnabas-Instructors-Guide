## Lesson Overview

In this lesson we will assemble the robot arm base

## Arm Base Assembly

### Tutorial Video

Notes:

- Watch until 22:45
- Newer models include a gray metal servo motor.  Make sure to use that one for the arm base motor.  See [video](https://youtu.be/TFep5o_B7lE) for help.
- Having trouble with the screws not self-tapping?  This can happen if the holes in the wood are too big from either imperfections or from being stripped.  See [video](https://youtu.be/VqSkfI2I-TE) for help.

### Written Instructions

### STEP 1. Build Base Motor Assembly

Assemble the base motor assembly using:

- 1 x Servo Motor (Use gray metal servo motor if it is included in your kit)
- 2 x M3x10 Screws
- 2 x Wood Pieces

Make sure that the screw holes on the wood pieces align perfectly so that the screws can go in straight.  You may need to flip/rotate the wood pieces a few times until you get it right.  The screws will self-tap into the wood.

Having trouble with the screws not self-tapping?  This can happen if the holes in the wood are too big from either imperfections or from being stripped.  See [video](https://youtu.be/VqSkfI2I-TE) for help.

### STEP 2. Assemble Platform Screws

Assemble platform screws using the following:

- 4 x M3x30 Screws
- 4 x Nuts (Regular)

Notice that the nuts are not tightened all the way.  We will tighten them in the next step when we attach the base motor assembly.

### STEP 3. Attach Base Motor To Platform

Align the base motor assembly to the platform screws so that they are perfectly matched.  

*IMPORTANT:* If you try to do this step without aligning the screws, you may damage the base motor assembly.  You may need to rotate the base motor platform several times until you get the right orientation.  When aligned correctly, ALL screws are perfectly straight.

Once aligned, screw the screws into the base motor platform and tighten the nuts.  The screw will self-tap into the base motor assembly wood.
