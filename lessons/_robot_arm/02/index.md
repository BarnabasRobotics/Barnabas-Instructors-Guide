### Lesson Overview

In this lesson we'll put your hardware together and connect the motors to it.

### Introducing The Hardware

The hardware consists of two parts: 

- Arduino Uno-Compatible board - This board will be on the bottom, and will be programmed by your computer
- Daughter Board - This board fits on top of the Arduino Uno-Compatible board and allows you to add the ability to control your robot arm using knobs.  Think of it as an expansion pack.

### Mount The Arduino Uno-Compatible Board

First let's mount the Arduino compatible board to the robot arm using the included screws.

### Attach The Daughter Board

Take the daughter board and stick it on top of the Arduino Uno-Compatible board.  It should look like the picture below once completed.  Make sure to match up the pins.  They should align exactly.
