### Place the Hardware
Using your zip ties, tie your hardware down onto the car.  Use the double stick foam tape on the back of the bread board to stick it onto the car chassis.  Attach the Noggin to the top side of chassis with zip ties. Be sure to leave the barrel jack accessible.  Using the sticky backside of the breadboard, place the breadboard firmly in the front edge of the chassis.
