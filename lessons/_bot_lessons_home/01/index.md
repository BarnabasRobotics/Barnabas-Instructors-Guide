disciplines:
    - "ETS1.B:  Developing Possible Solutions:  Research on a problem should be carried out before beginning to design a solution.  (3-5-ETS1-2)"

technical_skills:
    - We will identify the basic parts of a robot.  We will work together to build, learn, teach, and inspire.
life_skills:
    - Teamwork
    - Inspiration
    - Communication

essential_questions:
    - What are the similarities and differences between robots and humans?  
    - What is your favorite robot?  
    - What do robots help us do?  
    - What are the 4 main parts that make up a robot?  
    - What are the 4 types of engineering that make up robotics?  
    - What does it mean to encourage somebody?

anticipatory:
    - Student definitions or examples of encouragement and community  
    - "Student understanding of functions of the human body parts:  body, brain, heart, and soul"

practice:
    - Student drawing of robots and label the 4 parts

assessment:
    - The labeled final drawing of the student’s favorite robot
    - Students explain how/why robot and human parts are similar  
    - Students provide examples of encouragement and community

      - What are the 4 major parts of any robot?
      - What type of engineering is related to each of those parts?
      - What are we going to learn about and how are we going to learn?
    mindset:
        - How can you help make the class a good learning community?

### What is Robotics?  
#### Connecting Engineering Disciplines
Robotics is the combination of 3 different fields of engineering into a moving machine: (1) electrical engineering; (2) mechanical engineering; and (3) software programming. Below is a brief explanation of how each of the 3 types of engineering fields and the role they each play in a robot:

1) _Mechanical Engineering​_ ​focuses on the design, construction, and movement of machines. By definition, a robot has to have a moving part.  Imagine a human arm with joints at the shoulder and the elbow to move back and forth. Similarly, the mechanical part of a robot may be a motor, lever, or gear that helps the robot move. A mechanical engineer may also design the outside of the robot to help to protect the fragile parts inside of the robot.

2) _Electrical Engineering​_ ​focuses on the design and distribution of electricity within machines. A robot must have a power source to get its electricity. A robot’s power source may be a battery or an electrical outlet that it plugs into.  Imagine how the human heart pumps blood from the heart to the rest of our organs for our bodies to function.  Similarly, a battery or power source is like the robot's "heart" which supplies electricity to the rest of the robot’s body parts so that the robot can function.  For electricity to move throughout the robot’s body, it must have a network of wires and circuits through which electricity can travel.  This is similar to how human bodies have veins and arteries for blood to travel through to reach organs in the human body.

To process information, the human body has a central nervous system consisting of a brain and a network of nerves and muscles.  Likewise, a robot needs a “brain” to tell its body parts to move and function. The “brain” of the robot is the computer chip or circuit board. 

3) _Computer Science​_ is the study of how computers function and process information. For humans to move their arms, our brain must send a message to the arm telling it to move. This message is similar to a computer program/code.  The program/code dictates the way a robot behaves and functions.  This is essentially the robot’s "personality."

Professional engineers involved in designing and building robots need to depend on experts in the above engineering fields as well as a team of artists and other types of designers.  In other words, building a robot requires team work among individuals with varying skills. Through this project, you'll get a taste of each of these engineering disciplines and how they work in collaboration to build a robot from the ground up!  Let's get started!

#### Discussion
Let's learn about the similarities and differences between a human versus a robot.
