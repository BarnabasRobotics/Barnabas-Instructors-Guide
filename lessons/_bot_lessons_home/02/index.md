#### Review
* What is industrial design?

### Examining The Parts (10 min)
Check out your robot parts, the heads and front plates, to each of the students.  Examine the 3-D printed parts and think about how each 3-D printed part was laying on the bed as it was printed.  HINT: look at how the lines on the 3-D printed bots are oriented.

### Creating A Story (10 min)
Remembering what we learning about industrial design, think about who this robot is for, and what it does.  Is it for yourself?  Or someone else?  Now come up with a design for your robot.  Think of colors and even sketches or words that you want to put your on your robot.  Keep in mind who you are designing for.  This will guide you in making your design decisions!
