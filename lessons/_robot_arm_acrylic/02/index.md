Notes:

- You can peel off the protective plastic cover if you want to expose the glossy acrylic
- Newer kit uses Philips screws and Philips screwdriver for assembly instead of hex screw and allen wrench.
- Be sure not to over tighten screws as it can crack the acrylic

## Written Instructions

### STEP 1. Build Base Motor Assembly



Assemble the base motor assembly using:

- 1 x Servo Motor (**Use gray metal servo motor if it is included in your kit**)
- 2 x M3x10 Screws
- 2 x Acrylic Pieces

Additional Notes

- You can peel off the protective plastic cover if you want to expose the glossy acrylic
- Newer kit uses Philips screws and Philips screwdriver for assembly instead of hex screw and allen wrench.
- Be sure not to over tighten screws as it can crack the acrylic

There are 3 rectangular servo motor holder fastener pieces.  Make sure to use the smallest one.  Also, servo mounting screws might be at a slight diagonal to fit.  It is OK!

### STEP 2. Assemble Platform Screws

Assemble platform screws using the following:

- 4 x M3x30 Screws
- 4 x Nuts (Regular)
- 4 x Plastic Pillars
- 4 x M3x6 Screws
- 4 x Rubber Feet

Notice that the nuts are not tightened all the way.  We will tighten them in the next step when we attach the base motor assembly.

At this point you can also screw in the white pillars which that will hold your Arduino Uno later.  Look closely at the photos to determine which mounting holes to use.

Also add your 4 x rubber feet.

### STEP 3. Attach Base Motor To Platform

Align the base motor assembly to the platform screws so that they are perfectly matched.  

*IMPORTANT:* If you try to do this step without aligning the screws, you may damage the base motor assembly.  You may need to rotate the base motor platform several times until you get the right orientation.  When aligned correctly, ALL screws are perfectly straight.

Once aligned, screw the screws into the base motor platform and tighten the nuts.  The screw will self-tap into the base motor assembly acrylic.
