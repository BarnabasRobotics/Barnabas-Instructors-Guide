#### Walkthrough
Before diving into things you will need to become somewhat proficient with OnShape’s tools. Here are a few tips on how to move stuff around in OnShape:

1. Open the file "robot body front plate."
2. **Rotation**
  * Method 1: L-CLICK on arrows in the cube on the top left to rotate the entire perspective.![fig 3.4](fig-3_4.png){:class="image right"}
  * Method 2: R-CLICK on a part and move the mouse.
  * Method 3: L-CLICK on the "FRONT, BACK, LEFT, ETC." on the cube on the top left.
3. **Translating** a part (moving it up, down and side to side)
  * Method 1: Hold down CTRL and R-CLICK on the part to move it around.
  * Method 2: L-CLICK down using the SCROLL button to move it around.
4. **Zooming**
  * Use the scroll button to zoom in and out.
  * Go to "FRONT VIEW."
  * Press "F" to fit the part into your screen.  This is called, "ZOOM TO FIT."

Now insert your "robot body front plate" file.  
Align the front plate with the body by left clicking on it and dragging it.  
You’ll need to rotate the views to get it to align correctly.
