title: Lesson 7 Exploring the Robotâ€™s Heart
suggested_time: 60-75 minutes

disciplines:
- "PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer: Energy can also be transferred from place to place by electric currents, which can then be used locally to produce motion, sound, heat, or light. The currents may have been produced to begin with by transforming the energy of motion into electrical energy. (4-PS3-2),(4-PS3-4)"

### Science and Engineering Practices
- "Planning and Carrying Out Investigations: Make observations to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence for an explanation of a phenomenon or test a design solution. (4-PS3-2)"
- "Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions: Apply scientific ideas to solve design problems. (4-PS3-4)"

### Cross-Cutting Concepts
- "Energy and Matter: Energy can be transferred in various ways and between objects. (4-PS3-1),(4-PS3-2),(4-PS3-3),(4-PS3-4)"
