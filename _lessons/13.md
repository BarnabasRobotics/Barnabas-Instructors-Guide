barriers: 
- Understanding angles (0°-180°)

anticipatory:
- We will use the servo motors to move the robot’s arms and turn its head.  

practice:
- Practice 3-5 and challenges 1-3  

assessment:
- Robot with head and arms movement with possible inclusion of music and blinking LED.  
- Make sure that the pins for head and arms are correct and the breadboard is completed correctly.
