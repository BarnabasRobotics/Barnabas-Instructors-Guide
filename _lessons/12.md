title: Lesson 12 The Buzzer
suggested_time: 60-75 minutes

disciplines: 
- "ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)"

### Science and Engineering Practices
- "Planning and Carrying Out Investigations: Plan and conduct an investigation collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence, using fair tests in which variables are controlled and the number of trials considered. (3-5-ETS1-3)"

### Cross-Cutting Concepts
- "Science is a Human Endeavor: Science affects everyday life. (4-PS3-4)"

depth:
- Level 1:  Recall and Reproduction
- Level 2:  Skills and Concepts
- Level 3:  Strategic Thinking and Reasoning
- Level 4:  Extended Thinking

barriers: 
- Students with hearing difficulties or trouble differentiating sound frequencies  
- Students who have a hard time with rhythm  

anticipatory:
- We will transfer our previous coding skills toward coding a buzzer to buzz at different frequencies to create music.  
- "Hearing or singing the songs to be used in this lesson: Hot Cross Buns, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and Happy Birthday (in case students donâ€™t know them)"

practice:
- Creating the songs Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Happy Birthday, or Mary had a Little Lamb  

assessment:
- The buzzer plays a song that the student has created  

materials:
- Barnabas Lesson 12 worksheet
- Materials used for setup in Lesson 10

- Speaker
- Resistor (4.7K Ohm)
- Computer with Arduino software
- Engineering Notebooks
- Pencils
- Mini Breadboard
