title: Lesson 10 &middot; Blinking in Code
suggested_time: 60-75 minutes

disciplines:
- "ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions: At whatever stage, communicating with peers about proposed solutions is an important part of the design process, and shared ideas can lead to improved designs. (3-5-ETS1-2)"
- "Tests are often designed to identify failure points or difficulties, which suggest the elements of the design that need to be improved. (3-5-ETS1-3)"
- "ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)"

### Science and Engineering Practices
- "Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions: Generate and compare multiple solutions to a problem based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the design problem. (3-5-ETS1-2)"

depth:
- Level 1:  Recall and Reproduction
- Level 2:  Skills and Concepts
- Level 3:  Strategic Thinking and Reasoning
- Level 4:  Extended Thinking

barriers: 
- Understanding the pauses necessary in coding  
- Correct breadboard set up to power LED  

anticipatory:
- We will create and decode a message using Morse Code by using coding skills in ArduBlock.  
- Demonstrate a simple pre-coded flashing LED with a Morse Code message (ie. Go go go!) and ask students to decode it using the Morse Code decoder  

practice:
- Student practicing different letters to code.  

assessment:
- Student has a completed, decodable message.  
- Is the breadboard correct to light up LED  
- Student following 100ms, 300ms, 1000ms in their coding?  

materials:
- Barnabas Lesson 10 worksheet
- Same setup as Lesson 9
