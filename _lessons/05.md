depth:
- Level 1:  Recall and Reproduction
- Level 2:  Skills and Concepts
- Level 3:  Strategic Thinking and Reasoning
- Level 4:  Extended Thinking

barriers: 
    - There shouldn’t be any barriers in this lesson

anticipatory:
    - Hand students a few 3-D printed objects, if you have them. What do they notice about the objects? What process do they think is needed to print the objects? 

practice:
    - Answering questions in Steps 3, 4, and 5

assessment:
    - Drawing of robot with color schemes to be used for painting in the next session  
    - Ability to name the parts of a 3-D printer  
    - Understanding the importance of designing a product before it is printed?  

materials:
    - Barnabas Lesson 5 worksheet
    - Portable 3-D printer
    - If a 3-D printer is not available for students to see, opt for the video
    - Document camera
