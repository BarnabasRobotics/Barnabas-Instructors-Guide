title: Lesson 2 Building our First Robot
suggested_time: 60 - 75 minutes
disciplines:
    - "3-5-ETS1-1. Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost."
    - "ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems: Possible solutions to a problem are limited by available materials and resources (constraints). The success of a designed solution is determined by considering the desired features of a solution (criteria). Different proposals for solutions can be compared on the basis of how well each one meets the specified criteria for success or how well each takes the constraints into account. (3-5-ETS1-1)"
    - "3-5-ETS1-3. Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved."
    - "ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)"
    - "Science is a Human Endeavor: Most scientists and engineers work in teams. (4-PS3-4)"
technical_skills:
    - Design

    - Community
essential_questions:
    - What is necessary of all community members to achieve a common goal?  
    - Why do we need one another?  
    - Why is it important to work together?  
    - What is the benefit of it?

vocab:
    - Servo motor

documents:
other:
depth:
- Level 1:  Recall and Reproduction
- Level 2:  Skills and Concepts
- Level 3:  Strategic Thinking and Reasoning
- Level 4:  Extended Thinking
barriers:
    - Lack of fine motor skills  
    - Minimal understanding of angles and force  
    - Lack of teamwork  
anticipatory:
    - We will build a simple robot using everyday materials.  
    - Students see the function of a servo motor (it moves 180 degrees). Ideally, projected under document camera.  
    - Objective of the challenge is for ALL teams to knock the cup placed 8" away from the robot off the edge of the table  
    - Setting of norms for collaboration within the team and with other teams  

practice:
assessment:
    - Ability of the robot to knock the plastic cup placed 8" away from the robot off the edge of the table  
    - Understanding 180 degrees of movement  
    - Reading a ruler to 8" (not centimeters)  
    - Students are not necessarily using all materials - they may share with other groups  
materials:
    - Barnabas Lesson 2 worksheet
    - Masking tape
    - Pipe cleaners
    - Strips of paper
    - Paper clips
    - Clothes pins
    - Popsicle sticks
    - Pennies
    - 1 Servo motor per group
    - 1 Arduino board for every 3-4 groups of 3-4 students (groups must share)
    - 9-Volt battery 
    - 1 Plastic cup for every 3-4 groups of 3-4 students (to be knocked over; groups must share)
    - 1 Ruler for every 3-4 groups of 3-4 students (must share)
    - Writing utensils
    - document camera [optional]

reflection:
    comprehension: "âœŽ :  What are the similarities and differences between robots and humans?"
    challenges: blank
    enjoyment: is this the same for all lessons?
    mindset: growth
    community:
