    ## Lesson 3 4 

title: Lesson 3 Building our Robot’s Body
title: Lesson 4 Advanced C.A.D.
suggested_time: 60-75 minutes  

disciplines:
    - "Define a simple design problem that can be solved through the development of an object, tool, process, or system and includes several criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. (3-5-ETS1-1)"
    - "Influence of Engineering, Technology, and Science on Society and the Natural World Engineers improve existing technologies or develop new ones. (4-PS3-4) xcut"

    ### Learning Target(s)
    We will learn to design our robot’s body using Computer-Aided Design (C.A.D.).

    - Why is it important to practice perserverance?  
    - Why should we take the opportunity to teach others what we know?  
    - Does teaching help others? ourselves?

barriers: 
    - Minimal understanding of 3-D concepts and geometric solids  
    - Minimal understanding of abstract perception  
    - Minimal understanding of angles (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)  
    - Difficulty visualizing the possible axes of a 3-D object  

anticipatory:
    - Students play with a physical geometric solid - rotating and translating the objects on an axis in varying degrees and talking about how the perception of the object changes  
    - Set the norm for frustration tolerance

practice:
    - Students work on their individual files to put the robot together and to design the front plate

assessment:
    - Every student’s robot should be personalized after the 4th lesson  
    - Left- and right-clicking  
    - Rotating and inserting the additional parts to the body  

materials:
    - Barnabas Lesson 3 & 4 worksheets
    - Computer
    - Internet connection
    - Onshape.com website
    - *NOTE*: teacher must create an onshape.com account ahead of time for the entire class to use.  All students will need access to the password.
    - Computer mouse for each device (ideal, but optional)
    - Whiteboard or poster (for posting the class onshape.com username and password)
