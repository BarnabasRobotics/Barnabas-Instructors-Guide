title: Lesson 9 The Blinking Light Challenge
suggested_time:  60-75 minutes

disciplines:
- "ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions: Tests are often designed to identify failure points or difficulties, which suggest the elements of the design that need to be improved. (3-5-ETS1-3)"
- "ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)"
### Cross-Cutting Concepts
- "Energy and Matter: Energy can be transferred in various ways and between objects. (4-PS3-1),(4-PS3-2),(4-PS3-3),(4-PS3-4)"

depth:
- Level 1:  Recall and Reproduction
- Level 2:  Skills and Concepts
- Level 3:  Strategic Thinking and Reasoning
- Level 4:  Extended Thinking

barriers: 
- Understanding that programs are fast and need pauses  
- Ability to break down actions  

anticipatory:
- We will create a light circuit and write a program with our computer so it turns on and off automatically. 
- Understanding coding activity - students giving explicit 1-step instructions to accomplish a task  

practice:
- Student create the circuit and write a program to turn on and off the LED  

assessment:
- Blinking LED connected to the breadboard  

materials:
- Barnabas Lesson 9 worksheet
- Computer
- Breadboard
- Mouse
- Keyboard
- ArduBlock [Arduino IDE Tool]
- Barnabas arduino board
- Jumper wires
- LED
- USB cable
