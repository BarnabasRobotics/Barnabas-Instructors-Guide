# Day 2 of 16 - Building our First Robot
> Suggested Time: 60-75 minutes

## Disciplinary Core Ideas 
- 3-5-ETS1-1. Define a simple design problem reflecting a need or a want that includes specified criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost.
- ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems: Possible solutions to a problem are limited by available materials and resources (constraints). The success of a designed solution is determined by considering the desired features of a solution (criteria). Different proposals for solutions can be compared on the basis of how well each one meets the specified criteria for success or how well each takes the constraints into account. (3-5-ETS1-1)

- 3-5-ETS1-3. Plan and carry out fair tests in which variables are controlled and failure points are considered to identify aspects of a model or prototype that can be improved.
- ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)

## Cross-Cutting Concepts: 
Science is a Human Endeavor: Most scientists and engineers work in teams. (4-PS3-4)  

## Learning Target(s)
We will build a simple robot using everyday materials.

# SESSION 7 – EXPLORING THE ROBOT’S HEART
> OVERVIEW: We will  learn how the "heart" of the robot works.  Remember, the "heart" refers to the battery of a robot.  We will explore the area of electrical engineering.  Have fun!

### STEP 1: Robot review
 and ✎: Make a simple sketch of your robot.  Label the 4 main parts of a robot.  
🗨 or ✎: What type of engineers work on each part of the robot’s body?  

### STEP 2: Learning more about how your robot’s heart works. 
🗨 or ✎: What is a current?  
🗨 or ✎: What is voltage?  
🗨 or ✎: What is the role of a battery?  
🗨 or ✎: What is the role of a wire?  
🗨 and ✎: What is a circuit?  

### STEP 3: More about circuits 

🗨 or ✎: What is a schematic?  
🗨 and ✎: What is the difference between a closed circuit and an open circuit?  
🗨 and ✎: What happens when there is a short circuit?  

### STEP 4: Reading our first schematic
Review the schematic below.   

The heart (V1) is the battery  
The 1.5V refers to the voltage, which has to do with the power of the battery.  The unit of voltage is Volt.  
The triangle-like symbol (L1) represents a LED (Light Emitting Diode)  
Both V1 and L1 are components.  
Notice that there are positive and negative sides on both components.  You will need to pay attention to these when you start building the schematic, because they need to match up, like they do in the schematic.  
Draw a path through the "circulation loop" on your schematic.  It should start at the positive side of the heart and end on the negative side of the heart.  

### STEP 5: Building our first circuit
Take out your AA battery and AA battery holder.  Check the voltage on the battery.  It should match the voltage label on your schematic.  
Place your AA battery into the battery holder.  Make sure that it is in the right direction.  The red wire should be connected to the positive side of the battery, and the black wire should be connected to negative side of the battery.  
Take out your LED.  NOTE: the longer wire coming out of the LED is the positive side.  
Take some time to put your circuit together, and see if you can get your LED to light up!  

### STEP 6: Did it work?
The LED needs 3 Volts to light up.  Take a look to see what voltage the battery puts out.  You’ll notice that we don’t have enough!  
Now think about how we can get our LED to light up.  

### STEP 7: Two batteries are better than one.
One way to address our issue is to combine two batteries.  Review the new schematic below.  You’ll see that we now have two batteries, which will double our total voltage to the LED.  

Find a partner and build your new circuit based on the schematic.  Remember to keep track of the positive and negative sides of all your components.  The connections need to match your schematic! 

### STEP 8: Bonus Challenges
Make a circuit that uses 4.5V.  
Make a circuit that turns on two lights at the same time.  
Make a circuit that turns on three or more lights at the same time!  

## Reflection
🗨 and ✎: What color does your LED shine?  
🗨 and ✎: What is the total voltage necessary to light the LED?  
🗨 and ✎: What happens when the wire connections are too loose or too tight?

___

# SESSION 8 – INTRODUCTION TO BREADBOARDS
> OVERVIEW: Today, we will learn about breadboards.  Breadboards helps us make circuits in a way where we can make strong connections without needing to hold the wires together.  

### STEP 1: Introducing the breadboard
Take a look at the picture of the breadboard below:

Notice that each row has 10 holes in it.  They are divided into sets of 5 (A-B-C-D-E, and F-G-H-I-J) by a column down the middle.  
How many rows are there?  
Each set of 5 holes has an individual wire underneath that connects the 5 holes together.  To illustrate, draw the three lines below to show three of the wires.  
Draw a line that connects A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1.  
Draw a line that connects A2, B2, C2, D2 and E2  
Draw a line that connects F1, G1, H1, I1 and J1  
Draw in the rest of the wires.  How many total wires do you end up with?  

### STEP 2: Our first breadboard circuit
Using what you’ve learned, now use the breadboard to make your 3V LED circuit.   

The goal here is to create a circuit that stays on without you needing to hold on to any wires.  HINT: You can stick the AA battery holder wires and LED wires directly into the breadboard.  

### STEP 3: Increasing the voltage
Now that we have learned how we use schematics to plan circuits, and how to actually build them, we will look at increasing the voltage, because our robot is going to need more than 1.5V to run!
Review this new schematic  

Note that Arduino is acting like the battery in this case (kind of – more on this later).  The 5V is the positive and the GND is the negative.  
What is the voltage of this new circuit?  

Notice R1.  R1 is a resistor.  The value is 10K Ohm, or 10,000 Ohm.  Do you remember when we need to use resistors?  

On the schematic, trace the path where electricity will flow.  It should start at 5V and end with GND.  

Now build this circuit using your breadboard.  HINT: You will need your 10K Ohm resistor (it has an orange stripe).  You will also need two bread-board wires.  Use a red and black one for this challenge.  
Once you are done, you’ll notice that the light does not turn on.  This is because you need to provide a main power source.  In this case, our 9V battery will be our main power source.  The Arduino will then take the 9V and reduce it to 5V for our robot.  This reduction in voltage is called "step-down" voltage regulation.  Sometimes you will have a circuit that increases the source voltage, which is called "step-up" voltage regulation.
Plug the 9V battery into the 9V battery holder, and stick it into the round power connector.  Your light should now turn on!  

### STEP 4: Review questions
💭 and ✎: The higher the resistor, the lower the flow of electricity.  The lower the resistor, the higher the flow of electricity.  If we change the resistance from 10K to 470 Ohm, what do you think will happen to the light?  

Try replacing the 10K Ohm resistor with the 470 Ohm resistor.  What happens to the light?  
Put the 10K Ohm resistor back into your circuit.  

The flow of electricity is called current.  If you have a lot of flow, you have high current.  If you have a little flow, you have low current.  You can actually calculate this current using a formula, called Ohms Law.  This is an important tool for engineers when they design circuits.  The formula is:

V (Voltage) = I (Current) x R (Resistance).   
The unit is Amps.  

If the voltage is 5V, what is the current when you use the 10K Ohm resistor?  
If the voltage is 5V, what is the current when you use the 470 Ohm resistor?  

🗨 or ✎: Have you seen a light switch that turns like a timer dial?  Think about how you might build something like that based on what you have learned.

# SESSION 9 – THE BLINKING LIGHT CHALLENGE
> OVERVIEW: This week, we will be creating a light circuit for your robot. 

### STEP 1: What is a power indicator?
What typically happens when you turn on electronics (cell phone, computer, tv, etc.)?

Electronics use power indicators to let us know that electronics are on.  Write down the two common components that are used to build power indicator circuits.  Remember that a circuit is the "loop" that is formed that allows electricity to flow through your electronics.  Every circuit needs a battery, or heart.  

### STEP 2: Building your circuit
Build the following circuit based on the schematic below.  Hints: You will need a resistor, LED and two jumper wires.  Also, remember that there is a plus and minus on the LED.  The minus of the LED should be connected to GND.  

Note that pin 7 is a digital output.  This will allow you to turn your light on and off using robot’s brain (the Arduino)!  
🗨 or ✎:  How many components do you see in your schematic?  

When you are breadboarding, remember that two different sides of a component are always connected to DIFFERENT wires (or rows).  
Using the breadboard drawing below, let’s create a wiring diagram so that we know how to build our circuit.  
Draw in your components (LED, Resistor, Arduino).  Remember that the LED has a plus and minus – the resistor doesn’t.  
Starting from the pin 7 on the Arduino, draw in the connections that will complete our circuit.  Remember that you’ll need to end up with a loop so that electricity can flow!  

Make sure that your drawing is correct.  Once you have it confirmed, go ahead and build your circuit!  

### STEP 3: Connecting your Arduino
You are now ready to connect your Arduino to your computer so that you can start programming!  
Using the USB cable, plug in the Arduino to your computer.  Make sure to first unplug any other batteries that are connected to your Arduino when you do this.  

### STEP 4: Opening the Software
Open the Arduino software by clicking on the Arduino icon on your computer desktop.  
Wait for the software to open  

### STEP 5: Selecting the COM Port
Go to TOOLS->PORT, and click on the item that starts with the 3 letters, "COM".  It says "COM21" in the picture below, but yours may say a different number.  

### STEP 6: Uploading
Click on the UPLOAD button and wait.  It will take a few minutes.  You will notice a green progress bar at the bottom right of your screen.  If you see "DONE UPLOADING", then you are good to go!  If you see red on your screen, you selected the wrong "COM", so go back to STEP 6, select a different "COM" port and try the upload again.  

### STEP 7: Open ArduBlock
You are now able to write a program to your Arduino!  Now open ArduBlock by going to TOOLS->ARDUBLOCK.  

The following screen will appear:  

### STEP 8: Writing Your First ArduBlock Program
Go to [CONTROL], and drag in a [LOOP-DO] block.  Click on [SAVE], type in your name, and click [SAVE] again.  Note that every program needs a [LOOP-DO].  

Now click [UPLOAD], type in your name, and click [SAVE].  Your program will now upload!  

### STEP 9: Programming your LED
Notice that we have a wire connected to digital output 7.  Can you guess which programming block allows us to control digital output 7.  HINT: look under [PINS].  Write down the name of the block.  

Notice that there is a #, and a HIGH/LOW.  What do you think we should put as the pin #?  

Try writing a program to turn your LED on.  Remember to click [SAVE] and then [UPLOAD]  
Try writing a program to turn your LEF off.  Remember to click [SAVE] and then [UPLOAD]  

### STEP 10: Make It Blink!
Now you will need a new block.  Go to [UTILITIES]->[delay milliseconds].  This block tells your program to wait a certain amount of time.  Note that 1000 milliseconds is the same as 1 second.  

CHALLENGES: 
CHALLENGE 1: Try writing a program that turns your light on for 1 second, off for one second, and then repeats forever  
CHALLENGE 2: Write a program that turns your light on for ½ a second, off for ½ a second, and then repeats forever.  
CHALLENGE 3: Write a program that makes your light blink as fast as possible!  
CHALLENGE 4: Write a program that makes blinks 5 times fast, 5 times slow, and repeats forever.  Hint: use the repeat block  
CHALLENGE 5: Write a program that can match these light patterns below.  
CHALLENGE 6: Create your own light patterns and challenge your classmates to program them!

# SESSION 12 - THE BUZZER
> OVERVIEW: You will learn how to use a buzzer to play music! 

### STEP 1: Building your circuit
We will not be taking our circuits apart from last week.  Instead, we will be ADDING to them!  
Build the following circuit based on the schematic below.  Hints: You will need a resistor, a buzzer and two jumper wires.  Can you predict which is the positive side of the buzzer?  

🗨 and ✎: How many components do you see in your schematic?  

When you are breadboarding, remember that two different sides of a component are always connected to DIFFERENT wires (or rows).  
Using the breadboard drawing below, let’s create a wiring diagram so that we know how to build our circuit.
Draw in your components (Buzzer, Resistor).  
Go ahead and draw in the necessary connections.  However, this time, we don’t want to connect GND directly to the Arduino.  We want to connect it on a row on the breadboard.  See which row is already connected to GND!  

Ask your teacher to see if your drawing is correct.  Once you have it confirmed, go ahead and build your circuit!  

### STEP 2: How does the buzzer work?
Note that pin 6 is a PWM.  A PWM is a signal that allows us to change the voltage that goes into the buzzer.  As we change the voltage, the buzzer sound will change!  
Every sound that your buzzer makes creates a certain frequency.  This frequency makes different notes – just like a piano.  

🗨 or ✎: How might we play music now?  

### STEP 3: Frequency Table
Using the frequency table below, you will be able to play specific notes to make music!  
Note that you have low notes (left column) as well as high notes (right column).  

### STEP 4: Music time!
Try to challenges below.  Because we are using a 10K resistor, you’ll need to put your ear pretty close to the hear the sound.  
Connect your Arduino.  If you forget how to start up ArduBlock, go back to the directions from the previous week
Program blocks.  This time, you’ll need a few more blocks:  
PINS-> tone  
Pin# should match your PWM pin  
Frequency should match the frequency of the note that you are trying to play  
PINS-> noTone  
Pin# should match your PWM pin  
Frequency should match the frequency of the note that you are trying to play  

PRACTICE:  
PRACTICE #1: Play "C" forever!  
PRACTICE #2: Play "C" for 1 second, and rest for 1 second.  Repeat that combination forever.  
PRACTICE #3: Play "c" for 500 ms, rest 500 ms and repeat forever.  
PRACTICE #4: Play "b" for 500 ms, rest 500 ms and repeat forever.  
PRACTICE #5: Play "b" for 1 sec, play "a" for 1 sec, play "g" for 1 sec, rest for 1 second and repeat forever.  You just played the song "Hot Cross Buns!"  

CHALLENGE:  
CHALLENGE #1: Play "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"  (CC GG AA G FF EE DD C GG).  
CHALLENGE #2: Play the "Happy Birthday" song (G G A G C B G G A G D C G G G E C C B A).  
CHALLENGE #3: Play "Mary Had a Little Lamb" (B A G A BB B <> AA A <> BB B <> B A G A BBBB AAA BAG).  
CHALLENGE #4: Play the "Super Mario Brothers" Theme Song!  
Note that there are both low notes and high notes on this one!  
CHALLENGE #5: Work with your neighbor to play a song together!  
CHALLENGE #6: Write your own song!  

## Reflection 
🗨 and ✎: What patterns did you find in today’s coding activities?

## Lesson Plan
Keep multiple: ways of representation, ways of action and expression, and methods of engagement in mind.  
Welcome students to the community building environment (ie. students sitting in a circle)  
Describe the goal of today: Move the robot’s arms and head using the servo motors  
Breadboard the servo motors so that they are connected to the arduino board, be careful to note which wires are connected to the pins for the left arm, right arm, and head.  
Remind students that servo motors have a motion limit of 0°-180°. It is helpful to show them the movement with their arms or with their heads (turn head from left to right, mentioning that the center would be 90°)  
Go over Practice 1 and 2 together, then see if students can independently complete Practice 3-5.  
Move on to Challenges 1 and 2. Let students know that ultimately, they will combine all of the coding skills (servo motor, LED, and buzzer) to make their robot function.  
15 minutes before the end of the session, let students show the movement of their robots that they have coded.   
Clean up work space  
Closing circle/debrief - Discuss the EQ of the day.

# SESSION 13 – MAKE YOUR ROBOT WAVE!
> OVERVIEW: We will make your robot wave (or shake his/her head). 

### STEP 1: Introduction to servos
The servo motor has an axle that rotates 180 degrees.  It only moves along that circular path.  
Explain the significance of the 3 wires on the PWM wires coming out of the servos. 5V (RED) powers the servo motor.  GND (BROWN) is ground, and the orange wire gives information.  The Arduino uses the orange wire to tell the motor what degree to turn to.  We call the yellow wire, SIGNAL.  

### STEP 2: Attaching your servo motors to your robot’s body
Connect the servo motor to one of the arm or head sockets on your robot.  You’ll need two 7/16" servo screws and two lock nuts per servo motor to keep them in place.  Use the provided allen wrench.  
Attach your robot's head or arm to the servo motor.   
Use the 1/8" screw to attach the head (unless there is a coupling on the head already)  
Use the 9/16" (the longest one) servo screw to screw in the arm.  
WARNING: You will notice that the motor won't allow you to physically turn the motor shaft more than 180 degrees.  Be careful not to keep turning it more than the limit (you will feel it stop mechanically).  Doing so may damage the plastic gears inside, which will prevent your motor from moving.  

### STEP 3: Wiring up your motor
Pull the cables coming out of the servo motors through the hole on the bottom of your robot.  There should be three in total.  
Look at the wiring diagram below.  Based on what you’ve learned, add the necessary wires to connect your motor!  

### STEP 4: Programming motion
Connect your Arduino.  If you forget how to start up ArduBlock, go back to the directions from the previous week  
Program blocks.  This time, you’ll need a few more blocks:  
PINS-> Servo  
Pin# should match your PWM pin  
Angle accepts a value between 0 and 180 degrees  

PRACTICE:  
PRACTICE #1: Go to 0 degrees.  
PRACTICE #2: Go to 90 degrees.  
PRACTICE #3: Go to 0 degrees, wait 1 second, go to 90 degrees, wait 1 second, and repeat.  
PRACTICE #4: Make your robot wave very quickly.  
PRACTICE #5: Make your robot wave very slowly.  

CHALLENGES:  
CHALLENGE #1: Make your robot wave AND light up at the same time.  
CHALLENGE #2: Make your robot turn his light on while it is moving, but turn his light off while he is stopped.  
CHALLENGE #3: Make your robot light up, play music, and move all at the same time!  

## Reflection
🗨 and ✎: What can limit a robot’s movements?  

___

## Supporting Materials
Coding: For students who have a hard time making their robots move, look at their code and act it out. There is usually a missing pause or not moving the servo motor back to its original position.

# Day 14, 15, 16 of 16 - Building Your Final Circuit
> Suggested Time:  60-75 minutes each

## Science and Engineering Practices:
- Asking Questions and Defining Problems: Define a simple design problem that can be solved through the development of an object, tool, process, or system and includes several criteria for success and constraints on materials, time, or cost. (3-5-ETS1-1)
- Planning and Carrying Out Investigations: Plan and conduct an investigation collaboratively to produce data to serve as the basis for evidence, using fair tests in which variables are controlled and the number of trials considered. (3-5-ETS1-3)
- Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions: Generate and compare multiple solutions to a problem based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints of the design problem. (3-5-ETS1-2)

## Disciplinary Core Ideas 
- ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting Engineering Problems: Possible solutions to a problem are limited by available materials and resources (constraints). The success of a designed solution is determined by considering the desired features of a solution (criteria). Different proposals for solutions can be compared on the basis of how well each one meets the specified criteria for success or how well each takes the constraints into account. (3-5-ETS1-1)
- ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions: At whatever stage, communicating with peers about proposed solutions is an important part of the design process, and shared ideas can lead to improved designs. (3-5-ETS1-2)
- Tests are often designed to identify failure points or difficulties, which suggest the elements of the design that need to be improved. (3-5-ETS1-3)
- ETS1.C: Optimizing the Design Solution: Different solutions need to be tested in order to determine which of them best solves the problem, given the criteria and the constraints. (3-5-ETS1-3)

## Cross-Cutting Concepts:
Science is a Human Endeavor: Most scientists and engineers work in teams. (4-PS3-4)

# Appendix A

Questions to Consider when planning in order to meet the needs of ALL Students.

Multiple Ways of Representation  
How will you present content so that it meets the needs of all learners?  
Is the information represented in different ways to meet the needs of visual, auditory and kinesthetic  learners?  
For example, utilize guided notes and graphic organizers in addition to lecture or have books at several different levels on the same topic  
Multiple Ways of Engagement  
How will you provide multiple pathways for students to actually learn the material presented?  
How will the have active mental and physical engagement?  
How will they practice?  
For example, some learners benefit from small group learning opportunities; others require more focused practice with precise feedback, while others benefit from working independently.  
Some need to write, others need to talk through ideas first before they understand while others may need to physically represent what they are learning.  
Multiple Ways of Action and Expression  
How will students demonstrate what they have learned?
