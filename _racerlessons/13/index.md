### Survey the Racer Dimensions

Based on the drawing, figure out the optimal dimensions for front and back license plates.  The recommended dimensions is 2.0" (Length) x .1.0" (Height)

![fig 13.1](fig-13_1.jpg){:class="image "}

### Designing Your Plates
1. Create rectangle with the center at the origin of the front plane
1. Add dimensions to make the dimensions precisely 2.0" x 1.0"
1. Extrude the rectangle 0.5"
1. Create 0.1" hole using a sketch
1. Copy the hole and add it to the same sketch
1. Create holes using the extrude "subtract" function
1. Add Text
1. Extrude The text
1. Copy part
1. Add shape and extrude it on the second part
